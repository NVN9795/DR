This project involves the development of a computer vision model using Multi-Headed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect and classify Diabetic Retinopathy. The model is trained on a dataset of retinal images and achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying different stages of Diabetic Retinopathy. The project demonstrates the use of advanced deep learning techniques for medical diagnosis and can be a valuable addition to healthcare technology.
